## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

**Parallel Test Execution**

1. **Unit Tests**: Pricing Engine, API, Web (parallel)
2. **Integration Tests**: API endpoints with database
3. **Quality Checks**: ESLint, TypeScript, security audit
4. **Build Verification**: All packages build successfully
5. **Coverage Analysis**: Merged reports and PR comments

**Quality Gates**

- All tests must pass before merge
- Coverage thresholds must be met
- No security vulnerabilities allowed
- Build must complete successfully

**Artifacts & Reporting**

- Coverage reports stored for 30 days
- Test results commented on PRs
- Build artifacts for deployment
- Security scan results

## Testing Best Practices

### Writing Effective Tests

**Unit Tests**

- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Test one thing at a time
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both happy paths and error cases

**Integration Tests**

- Test complete workflows
- Use real database operations (in-memory)
- Verify authentication and authorization
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Clean up data between tests

**Frontend Tests**

- Test user interactions, not implementation details
- Use accessible queries (getByRole, getByLabelText)
- Test component behavior, not internal state
- Mock API calls and external dependencies
- Test loading states and error handling

### Test Data Management

**Factories and Fixtures**

```typescript
// Example test data factory
export const TestDataFactory = {
  createUser: (overrides = {}) => ({
    id: 'test-user-id',
    email: 'test@example.com',
    role: 'admin',
    ...overrides,
  }),

  createCustomer: (overrides = {}) => ({
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    email: 'john@test.com',
    type: 'residential',
    ...overrides,
  }),
};
```

**Database Seeding**

- Consistent test data across environments
- Cleanup between test runs
- Realistic but anonymized data
- Performance optimized for testing

## Performance & Optimization

### Test Execution Performance

**Parallel Execution**

- Unit tests run in parallel for speed
- Integration tests run sequentially for data consistency
- Package-level parallelization with NX

**Optimization Strategies**

- In-memory database for integration tests
- Shared test setup and teardown
- Efficient mock strategies
- Selective test execution in development

**CI/CD Performance**

- Parallel job execution in GitHub Actions
- Cached dependencies for faster builds
- Optimized Docker images for test environments
- Early failure detection to save resources

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Test Failures**

- Check test data consistency
- Verify mock configurations
- Ensure proper cleanup between tests
- Check async operation handling

**Coverage Issues**

- Review uncovered lines in reports
- Add tests for missing branches
- Verify test file patterns in Jest config
- Check exclusion patterns

**Integration Test Issues**

- Verify database connectivity
- Check service startup order
- Validate environment variables
- Review network configurations

### Debugging Tests

**Local Development**

```bash
# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run specific test file
npx jest apps/api/src/auth/auth.service.spec.ts

# Debug with verbose output
npm test -- --verbose

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

**CI/CD Debugging**

- Check GitHub Actions logs
- Review artifact uploads
- Verify environment setup
- Check service health
