## Running Tests

### Run All P0 Service Tests

```bash
npm run test:api
```

### Run Specific Service Tests

```bash
# Estimates Service
npm run test:api -- estimates.service.spec

# Opportunities Service
npm run test:api -- opportunities.service.spec

# Pricing Rules Service
npm run test:api -- pricing-rules.service.spec

# Tariff Settings Service
npm run test:api -- tariff-settings.service.spec
```

### Run with Coverage

```bash
npm run test:coverage:api
```

### Watch Mode (for development)

```bash
npm run test:api -- --watch
```

## Test Patterns and Best Practices

### AAA Pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)

All tests follow the AAA pattern:

```typescript
it('should create a new opportunity', async () => {
  // Arrange
  const mockDoc = createMockOpportunity();

  // Act
  const result = await service.create(baseOpportunityDto, userId);

  // Assert
  expect(result).toBeDefined();
  expect(result.status).toBe('open');
});
```

### Mock Strategy

- **Mock external dependencies**: All MongoDB models and external services are mocked
- **Use factories**: Reusable mock factories for consistency
- **Reset between tests**: `afterEach(() => jest.clearAllMocks())`
- **Isolate units**: Each test tests one specific behavior

### Test Organization

```
describe('ServiceName', () => {
  describe('methodName', () => {
    it('should handle valid input', () => { });
    it('should handle edge case', () => { });
    it('should throw error for invalid input', () => { });
  });
});
```

## Coverage Goals and Results

### Target Coverage

- **Line Coverage**: 80%+
- **Branch Coverage**: 75%+
- **Function Coverage**: 90%+
- **Statement Coverage**: 80%+

### Current Results

Run `npm run test:coverage:api` to see current coverage metrics.

## Known Issues and Notes

### Test Failures

Some tests in the Estimates service may fail due to the pricing engine returning results in a slightly different format than expected. These are being addressed:

**Issue**: `result.estimate.totalPrice` is undefined
**Cause**: Pricing engine result structure differs from mock expectations
**Fix**: Update test expectations to match actual pricing engine output structure

### Future Improvements

1. **Add Integration Tests**: Current tests are unit tests. Add integration tests that test with real database.

2. **E2E Tests**: Add end-to-end tests that test the entire flow through the API.

3. **Performance Tests**: Add tests that measure and assert on performance metrics.

4. **Visual Regression Tests**: For UI components, add visual regression testing.

5. **Contract Tests**: Add contract tests for API endpoints.

## Adding More Tests

### To add tests for a new service:

1. **Create fixture file**:

```typescript
// apps/api/test/fixtures/new-service.fixture.ts
export const mockData = { ... };
```

2. **Create test file**:

```typescript
// apps/api/src/new-service/new-service.service.spec.ts
import { Test, TestingModule } from '@nestjs/testing';
import { createMockModel } from '../../test/mocks/model.factory';
import { mockData } from '../../test/fixtures/new-service.fixture';

describe('NewService', () => {
  // ... tests
});
```

3. **Run tests**:

```bash
npm run test:api -- new-service.service.spec
```

## Maintenance

### When to Update Tests

- **When adding new features**: Add tests for new functionality
- **When fixing bugs**: Add regression tests
- **When refactoring**: Ensure tests still pass
- **When APIs change**: Update test expectations

### Test Maintenance Checklist

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Coverage meets thresholds
- [ ] No skipped tests without justification
- [ ] Test names are descriptive
- [ ] Tests are independent
- [ ] Mocks are properly reset
