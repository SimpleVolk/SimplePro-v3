**Workaround:**

```css
.backdrop {
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
  backdrop-filter: blur(2px);
  /* Fallback for browsers without blur support */
  @supports not (backdrop-filter: blur(2px)) {
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6); /* Slightly darker */
  }
}
```

## Automated Browser Testing

### Cross-Browser Testing with Playwright

```typescript
import { test, devices } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Mobile Navigation - Cross Browser', () => {
  const browsers = ['chromium', 'firefox', 'webkit'];

  browsers.forEach((browserType) => {
    test(`should work on ${browserType}`, async ({ browser }) => {
      const context = await browser.newContext({
        ...devices['iPhone 13'],
      });
      const page = await context.newPage();

      await page.goto('/');
      await page.click('[aria-label="Open menu"]');
      // ... test assertions
    });
  });
});
```

## Browser Analytics Recommendations

Track these metrics in production:

- Browser/version distribution
- Mobile vs desktop usage
- Feature support detection
- Error rates by browser
- Performance metrics by browser

Use this data to:

- Prioritize testing on popular browsers
- Drop support for unused browsers
- Identify browser-specific issues
- Optimize for most-used browsers
