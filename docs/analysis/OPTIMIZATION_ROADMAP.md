## Weekly Review Checklist

At the end of each week, verify:

- [ ] All planned tasks completed
- [ ] Performance metrics improved as expected
- [ ] No regressions in existing features
- [ ] Tests passing (unit + integration)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Team trained on new patterns
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards updated

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks

1. **Cache invalidation bugs**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing, short TTLs initially
   - Rollback: Clear cache endpoint, disable caching

2. **WebSocket memory issues**
   - Mitigation: Gradual rollout, monitoring
   - Rollback: Revert to previous gateway implementation

3. **Frontend bundle size regression**
   - Mitigation: Bundle analyzer in CI/CD
   - Rollback: Lazy loading can be disabled per-component

4. **Database query performance regression**
   - Mitigation: Query profiling, A/B testing
   - Rollback: All optimizations are additive, can revert

### Rollback Strategy

Each optimization is **independent** and can be rolled back without affecting others:

- N+1 fixes → Revert to original service methods
- Caching → Set TTL=0 or clear cache
- React Query → Remove provider wrapper
- Code splitting → Change lazy imports to regular imports
