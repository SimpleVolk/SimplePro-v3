## Testing Instructions

### 1. Verify Replica Set Setup

```bash
# Check all members healthy
npm run replica:health

# Expected output:
# Container Status:
#   ✓ simplepro-mongodb-primary: running (health: healthy)
#   ✓ simplepro-mongodb-secondary1: running (health: healthy)
#   ✓ simplepro-mongodb-secondary2: running (health: healthy)
#
# Replica Set Status:
#   Set Name: simplepro-rs
#   Members:
#     ★ 172.22.0.10:27017: PRIMARY (health: 1)
#     ● 172.22.0.11:27017: SECONDARY (health: 1)
#     ● 172.22.0.12:27017: SECONDARY (health: 1)
#
# Replication Lag:
#   ✓ 172.22.0.11:27017: 0.02 seconds behind
#   ✓ 172.22.0.12:27017: 0.03 seconds behind
```

### 2. Test Automatic Failover

```bash
# Stop primary
docker stop simplepro-mongodb-primary

# Wait 30 seconds and check status
sleep 30
docker exec simplepro-mongodb-secondary1 mongosh -u admin -p password123 \
  --authenticationDatabase admin --eval "rs.status()"

# Expected: One of the secondaries is now PRIMARY

# Restart old primary (will rejoin as secondary)
docker start simplepro-mongodb-primary
sleep 30
npm run replica:health
```

### 3. Test Backup and Restore

```bash
# Create backup
npm run backup:mongodb

# List backups
ls -lh /backups/mongodb/

# Test restore (dry run)
BACKUP_DATE=$(ls -1 /backups/mongodb/ | tail -1)
./scripts/backup/mongodb-restore.sh $BACKUP_DATE --dry-run

# Expected: "Backup verification successful"
```

### 4. Test Monitoring

```bash
# Start monitoring stack
npm run monitoring:start

# Wait for services to start
sleep 30

# Check Prometheus targets
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/targets | jq '.data.activeTargets[] | {job: .labels.job, health: .health}'

# Expected: All targets show "up"

# Access Grafana
# Open: http://localhost:3000
# Login: admin / admin
```

## Architecture Overview

### Before (Single Node - SPOF)

```
Application
    │
    ▼
MongoDB (Single Instance)
    │
    ├─ If this fails → Complete outage
    ├─ No redundancy
    └─ No automatic recovery
```

### After (Replica Set - High Availability)

```
Application (Read: secondaryPreferred, Write: primary)
    │
    ├───────────┬───────────┐
    ▼           ▼           ▼
Primary    Secondary1  Secondary2
(Writes)    (Reads)     (Reads)
    │           │           │
    └───────────┴───────────┘
      Replication (Oplog)

Benefits:
✅ If primary fails → Automatic election (<30s)
✅ If secondary fails → Reads continue on other nodes
✅ Read scaling → Distribute across secondaries
✅ Zero downtime maintenance → Update one node at a time
```
