# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

SimplePro-v3 is a **single-tenant internal web app** designed to fix ineffective sales, inaccurate estimates, and inefficient operations for moving companies. Built with NX monorepo architecture, it provides deterministic pricing estimates, centralized CRM, operations management, and mobile crew applications.

### Core Requirements

**Business Problems Solved:**

- **Ineffective Sales**: Centralized CRM with automated follow-ups, templates, partner ingestion, and full activity audit
- **Inaccurate Estimates**: Deterministic, auditable estimates from room-by-room inventory plus rules, location handicaps, and seeded evaluator
- **Inefficient Operations**: Dispatch calendar, drag-and-drop resource assignment, crew availability/checklists, real-time job status, payroll calculation

**Technical Requirements:**

- **Mobile-first dark UI** with offline-capable crew app
- **Signature and photo capture** for crew operations
- **SSO + RBAC** with PII masking and encrypted storage
- **Complete audit logs** and configurable mock integrations
- **Internal-only deployment** with enterprise security

**Deliverable Components:**

- âœ… Architecture diagram and ERD
- âœ… Rules JSON and deterministic estimator with unit tests (38 passing tests)
- âœ… **Next.js inventoryâ†’estimate page** (Complete web application with dark UI)
- ðŸ”„ React Native crew screen with offline capabilities
- ðŸ”„ GraphQL resolver and API endpoints
- ðŸ”„ Docker-compose deployment setup
- ðŸ”„ Seed data for development
- ðŸ”„ Observability and monitoring
- ðŸ”„ Backup/DR procedures
- ðŸ”„ ESIGN/UETA compliance features
- ðŸ”„ Admin-only rules editing interface

## Architecture

This is a **NX monorepo** with the following structure:

- **apps/api**: NestJS backend API with GraphQL, REST endpoints, MongoDB integration
- **packages/pricing-engine**: Core deterministic pricing calculator with rules engine
- **apps/web**: Next.js web dashboard with estimate calculator and dark theme UI
- Future: **apps/mobile**: React Native crew app

The system emphasizes **deterministic calculations** - same input always produces same output with SHA256 hash verification for auditability.

## Key Architectural Concepts

### Deterministic Pricing Engine

The core of the system is the **DeterministicEstimator** in `packages/pricing-engine`. This calculator:

- Takes structured input (customer details, inventory, locations, services)
- Applies configurable pricing rules in priority order
- Applies location handicaps (stairs, parking, access difficulty)
- Returns identical results for identical inputs (SHA256 hash verified)
- Provides complete audit trail of applied rules and calculations

**Usage Pattern:**

```typescript
import { DeterministicEstimator, defaultRules } from '@simplepro/pricing-engine';

const estimator = new DeterministicEstimator(
  defaultRules.pricingRules,
  defaultRules.locationHandicaps
);

const result = estimator.calculateEstimate(inputData, userId);
```

### Rules Engine

Pricing rules are JSON-configurable with:

- **Conditions**: Field-based rules (weight > 8000, isWeekend = true, etc.)
- **Actions**: Price modifications (add_fixed, add_percentage, multiply, etc.)
- **Priority**: Execution order (lower numbers first)
- **Service Types**: Applicable to local, long_distance, storage, packing_only

Rules are located in `packages/pricing-engine/src/data/default-rules.json`.

### Data Flow Architecture

1. **Input Validation**: EstimateInput schema with comprehensive validation
2. **Rule Processing**: Sequential application by priority
3. **Location Analysis**: Geographic and access difficulty modifiers
4. **Price Breakdown**: Categorized cost components (labor, materials, transportation, etc.)
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete calculation history with rule impacts

### NX Workspace Configuration

- **TypeScript Path Mappings**: Use `@simplepro/pricing-engine` to import between packages
- **Shared Dependencies**: Common configs in root, specific deps in individual packages
- **Build Dependencies**: Pricing engine builds before API (dependency graph)

## Development Patterns

### Adding New Pricing Rules

1. Define rule in `packages/pricing-engine/src/data/default-rules.json`
2. Add test cases in `packages/pricing-engine/src/estimator.test.ts`
3. Rules are automatically loaded and applied by priority

### Working with Estimates

All estimate calculations should flow through the DeterministicEstimator to ensure:

- Consistency across the application
- Complete audit trails
- Reproducible results for the same input

### API Development

The API follows NestJS patterns with:

- Module-based architecture (users, customers, estimates, jobs, crews)
- MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- GraphQL + REST endpoints
- JWT authentication with RBAC
- Comprehensive input validation with class-validator

## Environment Requirements

- **Node.js**: >= 20.0.0
- **npm**: >= 10.0.0
- **Docker**: Required for development infrastructure
- **MongoDB**: 7.0+ (via Docker)
- **Redis**: 7+ (via Docker)

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing with Jest
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoint testing
- **Deterministic Testing**: Pricing engine validation with known inputs/outputs
- **Test Data**: Comprehensive scenarios in `packages/pricing-engine/src/test-data/`

The pricing engine includes extensive test coverage with multiple scenarios (studio moves, large moves with pianos, long distance, etc.) to ensure calculation accuracy.

## Web Application (apps/web)

### Features Implemented

The Next.js web application provides a complete estimate calculator interface:

**EstimateForm Component (`apps/web/src/app/components/EstimateForm.tsx`):**
- Comprehensive form for move details collection
- Service type selection (local, long distance, packing only)
- Pickup/delivery location with access difficulty assessment
- Inventory details (weight, volume, crew size)
- Special items handling (piano, antiques, artwork)
- Additional services (packing, assembly, storage)
- Real-time validation and error handling

**EstimateResult Component (`apps/web/src/app/components/EstimateResult.tsx`):**
- Complete price breakdown display
- Applied pricing rules with explanations
- Location handicaps and adjustments
- Calculation metadata with deterministic hash
- Professional dark theme styling

**Key Technical Features:**
- **Mobile-first responsive design** with dark theme
- **Direct pricing engine integration** using `@simplepro/pricing-engine`
- **TypeScript with strict type checking**
- **CSS Modules for component styling**
- **Real-time estimate calculations**
- **Deterministic hash display** for calculation verification

### Development Server

```bash
# Start the web development server
nx dev web

# Application runs on http://localhost:3000
```

### Current Status

- âœ… **Production build working** - All TypeScript errors resolved
- âœ… **Development server functional** - Ready for testing and development
- âœ… **Pricing engine integration** - Full deterministic calculation support
- âœ… **Dark theme UI** - Professional moving company interface
- âœ… **Form validation** - Comprehensive input validation and error handling

## Monorepo Dependencies

When working across packages:

- Import using TypeScript path mappings: `@simplepro/pricing-engine`
- Build dependencies are managed by NX automatically
- Shared configurations inherit from workspace root
- Each package maintains its own test configuration

## Next Development Priorities

Based on the current project status, the recommended next steps are:

### 1. API Backend Implementation
- Set up GraphQL resolvers for estimate operations
- Implement NestJS modules (customers, estimates, jobs, crews)
- MongoDB integration with data persistence
- Authentication and authorization system

### 2. Enhanced Web Features
- Customer management interface
- Job tracking and dispatch calendar
- Historical estimates and reporting
- Admin interface for rules editing

### 3. Mobile Application
- React Native crew app with offline capabilities
- Signature and photo capture for job completion
- Real-time job status updates
- Crew availability and checklists

### 4. Infrastructure & Deployment
- Docker-compose deployment setup
- Database seed data and migrations
- Monitoring and observability
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures

The foundation is now solid with a working pricing engine and web interface. The deterministic calculation system ensures all future development will maintain accuracy and auditability.
