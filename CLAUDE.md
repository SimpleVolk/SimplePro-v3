## Key Architectural Concepts

### Deterministic Pricing Engine

The core of the system is the **DeterministicEstimator** in `packages/pricing-engine`. This calculator:

- Takes structured input (customer details, inventory, locations, services)
- Applies configurable pricing rules in priority order
- Applies location handicaps (stairs, parking, access difficulty)
- Returns identical results for identical inputs (SHA256 hash verified)
- Provides complete audit trail of applied rules and calculations

**Usage Pattern:**

```typescript
import { DeterministicEstimator, defaultRules } from '@simplepro/pricing-engine';

const estimator = new DeterministicEstimator(
  defaultRules.pricingRules,
  defaultRules.locationHandicaps
);

const result = estimator.calculateEstimate(inputData, userId);
```

**CRITICAL: Cross-Platform Compatibility**
- The pricing engine must work in both Node.js (API) and browser (Web) environments
- Uses fallback UUID generation: crypto.randomUUID → crypto.getRandomValues → Math.random
- ES Module compatible with proper package.json configuration

### Rules Engine

Pricing rules are JSON-configurable with:

- **Conditions**: Field-based rules (weight > 8000, isWeekend = true, etc.)
- **Actions**: Price modifications (add_fixed, add_percentage, multiply, etc.)
- **Priority**: Execution order (lower numbers first)
- **Service Types**: Applicable to local, long_distance, storage, packing_only

Rules are located in `packages/pricing-engine/src/data/default-rules.json`.

### Data Flow Architecture

1. **Input Validation**: EstimateInput schema with comprehensive validation
2. **Rule Processing**: Sequential application by priority
3. **Location Analysis**: Geographic and access difficulty modifiers
4. **Price Breakdown**: Categorized cost components (labor, materials, transportation, etc.)
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete calculation history with rule impacts

### NX Workspace Configuration

- **TypeScript Path Mappings**: Use `@simplepro/pricing-engine` to import between packages
- **Shared Dependencies**: Common configs in root, specific deps in individual packages
- **Build Dependencies**: Pricing engine builds before API (dependency graph)

## Development Patterns

### Adding New Pricing Rules

1. Define rule in `packages/pricing-engine/src/data/default-rules.json`
2. Add test cases in `packages/pricing-engine/src/estimator.test.ts`
3. Rules are automatically loaded and applied by priority

### Working with Estimates

All estimate calculations should flow through the DeterministicEstimator to ensure:

- Consistency across the application
- Complete audit trails
- Reproducible results for the same input

### Modern UI Development

**Critical Architecture Notes:**

1. **Sidebar Navigation Pattern** - The app uses a modern sidebar layout (`AppLayout` component) rather than horizontal tabs
2. **Component Lazy Loading** - Heavy components are lazy-loaded with `Suspense` for performance
3. **Settings System** - Comprehensive hierarchical settings system with 30+ pages organized by category
4. **Dashboard-First Approach** - Dashboard is the default landing page, not estimates
5. **Responsive Design** - All components support mobile-first responsive design with collapsible sidebar

**When Adding New Features:**
- Wrap new components in the `AppLayout` for consistent navigation
- Use `LoadingSkeleton` components for loading states
- Follow the established CSS Modules pattern for styling
- Maintain role-based access control for navigation items

### API Development

The API follows NestJS patterns with:

- Module-based architecture (auth, customers, estimates, jobs, crews, analytics, pricing-rules, tariff-settings)
- **MongoDB with Mongoose ODM** - Full database integration with schemas and indexes
- **JWT Authentication** - Access tokens (1h) and refresh tokens (7d) with session management
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** - Super admin, admin, dispatcher, crew roles with permissions
- **Password Security** - bcrypt hashing with 12 rounds, secure password change workflows
- **Session Management** - TTL indexes for automatic cleanup, multi-device session tracking
- **WebSocket Gateway** - Real-time job updates and crew communication
- REST endpoints (53+ routes) with comprehensive input validation using class-validator
- GraphQL support (configured but not fully implemented)

**Database Schemas:**
- **User Schema** (`apps/api/src/auth/schemas/user.schema.ts`) - Complete user management with roles and permissions
- **UserSession Schema** (`apps/api/src/auth/schemas/user-session.schema.ts`) - Session tracking with automatic expiration
- **Job Schema** (`apps/api/src/jobs/schemas/job.schema.ts`) - Comprehensive job lifecycle management with compound indexes
- **Customer Schema** (`apps/api/src/customers/schemas/customer.schema.ts`) - CRM with contact history
- **TariffSettings Schema** (`apps/api/src/tariff-settings/schemas/tariff-settings.schema.ts`) - Dynamic pricing configuration

**CRITICAL: Data Persistence Issue**
- ⚠️ `customers.service.ts` and `jobs.service.ts` currently use **in-memory Map storage**
- This is **temporary scaffolding** - data is lost on server restart
- MongoDB schemas exist but services need migration to use `@InjectModel()` pattern
- When fixing: Replace `private customers = new Map()` with Mongoose model injection

## Default Authentication Credentials

**Default Admin Login:**
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Email:** `admin@simplepro.com` (can also be used as username)
- **Password:** `Admin123!` (case-sensitive with exclamation mark)

**Important:** This is for development only. The password is case-sensitive and must include the exclamation mark.

## Modern UI Architecture

**Layout Transformation (Completed):**
- **AppLayout Component** (`apps/web/src/app/components/AppLayout.tsx`) - Main layout wrapper with sidebar + content areas
- **Sidebar Component** (`apps/web/src/app/components/Sidebar.tsx`) - Modern blue gradient sidebar with collapsible navigation
- **DashboardOverview Component** (`apps/web/src/app/components/DashboardOverview.tsx`) - KPI dashboard with real-time metrics
- **Comprehensive Settings System** (`apps/web/src/app/components/settings/`) - Hierarchical 30+ page settings interface

**Navigation Pattern:**
- Transformed from horizontal tabs to modern sidebar navigation
- Dashboard is the default landing page
- All existing components preserved and wrapped in new layout
- Role-based navigation filtering maintained

## Environment Requirements

- **Node.js**: >= 20.0.0
- **npm**: >= 10.0.0
- **Docker**: Required for development infrastructure
- **MongoDB**: 7.0+ (via Docker)
- **Redis**: 7+ (via Docker)

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing with Jest
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoint testing
- **Deterministic Testing**: Pricing engine validation with known inputs/outputs
- **Test Data**: Comprehensive scenarios in `packages/pricing-engine/src/test-data/`

The pricing engine includes extensive test coverage with multiple scenarios (studio moves, large moves with pianos, long distance, etc.) to ensure calculation accuracy.

## Common Development Issues & Solutions

### Login Issues
- **Problem**: "Invalid credentials" error
- **Solution**: Use correct password `Admin123!` (case-sensitive with exclamation mark)
- **Check**: Ensure API is running on port 3001 and MongoDB is connected via Docker

### Port Conflicts
- **Problem**: Multiple services trying to use same ports
- **Solution**: Kill conflicting Node.js processes
  - Windows: `TASKKILL /F /IM node.exe`
  - Linux/Mac: `killall node` or `lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9`
- **Check**: `netstat -ano | findstr :PORT_NUMBER` (Windows) or `lsof -i :PORT` (Mac/Linux)

### MongoDB Connection Issues
- **Problem**: "MongoServerError: Authentication failed"
- **Solution**:
  1. Ensure Docker containers are running: `npm run docker:dev`
  2. Check MongoDB logs: `docker logs simplepro-mongodb-dev`
  3. Verify credentials in `.env.local` match `docker-compose.dev.yml`
- **Default MongoDB credentials**: `MONGODB_USERNAME=admin`, `MONGODB_PASSWORD=password123`

### Build Failures
- **Problem**: TypeScript or dependency errors
- **Solution**:
  1. Clear caches: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json`
  2. Fresh install: `npm install`
  3. Rebuild: `npm run build`
- **Check**: Ensure Node.js >= 20.0.0 and npm >= 10.0.0

### TypeScript Type Errors in Pricing Engine
- **Problem**: Type errors when importing pricing engine in web app
- **Solution**: The pricing engine uses ES modules - ensure proper imports:
  ```typescript
  import { DeterministicEstimator, defaultRules } from '@simplepro/pricing-engine';
  // NOT: const { DeterministicEstimator } = require(...)
  ```

### CORS Errors in Development
- **Problem**: Web app cannot connect to API
- **Solution**: API is configured for ports 3009, 3010, 3000, 3004
- **Check**: Verify web app is running on one of these ports
- **Fix**: Update `apps/api/src/main.ts` allowedOrigins if using different port

## Critical Known Issues & Production Blockers

### 🔴 CRITICAL - Security Vulnerabilities (Fix Before Production)

1. **Next.js Security Issues** - Running unstable canary build with 7 vulnerabilities
   - **Current**: next@15.6.0-canary.39
   - **Fix**: Downgrade to stable `next@14.2.32` or `next@15.5.4`
   - **Action**: `npm install next@14.2.32 --save-exact`

2. **Default Admin Password Logged to Console**
   - **Location**: `apps/api/src/auth/auth.service.ts:158`
   - **Issue**: Password appears in console logs (security risk)
   - **Fix**: Remove password from console.warn, only log to `.secrets/` file

3. **Weak Rate Limiting**
   - **Current**: 100 login attempts per minute
   - **Fix**: Change to 5 attempts per 15 minutes in `apps/api/src/app.module.ts`

4. **Missing NoSQL Injection Protection**
   - **Issue**: Query parameters not validated in customers/jobs controllers
   - **Fix**: Add DTO validation for all query parameters

### 🟠 HIGH - Data Loss Risk

**In-Memory Storage Must Be Migrated to MongoDB:**
- `apps/api/src/customers/customers.service.ts` - Uses `Map<string, Customer>`
- `apps/api/src/jobs/jobs.service.ts` - Uses `Map<string, Job>`
- **Impact**: All customer and job data lost on API restart
- **Fix**: Use Mongoose models (schemas already exist in `/schemas` directories)

### 🟡 MEDIUM - Accessibility & Testing

1. **WCAG AA Violations** - Color contrast failures in sidebar and text
   - **Fix**: Update `Sidebar.module.css` contrast ratios to meet 4.5:1 minimum

2. **Test Coverage Insufficient** - Only 15% backend coverage, <10% frontend
